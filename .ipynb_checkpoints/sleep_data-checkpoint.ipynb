    "INTRODUCTION: \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset presented looks at factors that attribute to having a sleeping disorder. Columns in the data set include sleep duration (hours), quality of sleep (/10), stress(/10), age, number of daily steps, heart rate (beats per minute), physical activity level (/100), etc. Each factor goes into determining if the person survyed has no sleep disorder, insomina or sleep apnea. Insomina is described as when a  individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep. Moreover, sleep apnea is described as when an individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will be answering is based on our personal data, does a sleep disorder persist and if so which one? This is an important question for us to explore as we could possible identify and work towards finding a diagnosis for ourselves. This could lead to lifestyle changes that would give us an overall better quailty of life.\n",
